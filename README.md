#Monster Slayer
This is a front-end website that simulates a battle between a monster and a hero. 
Players can use 5 abilities (Attack, Special Attack, Heal, Block, Level Up) to defeat the monster or choose to surrender. 
The game includes a Battle Log and Health Bars to keep track of the progress and battle statistics.
Players have the chance for critical damage while attacking, a chance to use a special attack every 3 rounds, the opportunity to level up after 10 rounds, and a chance to reflect damage while blocking. 
Monsters also have the opportunity for critical damage and can attack while a player is healing or leveling up.
The outcome can result in a loss, a draw, or a win. Good luck, Monster Slayer!
